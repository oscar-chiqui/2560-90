<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p3">This class covers principles and practices of modern web application design, development and deployment. This class focuses on web server code development, deployment, and management, and will cover the aspects of front-end development needed to produce functional websites. Students will explore various types of web site hosting options. Students will use web application frameworks, databases, developer tools (such as testing suites and source control tools) and other resources to build and deploy web applications. Students will be introduced to security issues, and user experience considerations. Must be taken A-F.</p>

<p class="p3">Students will also consider user interface design (UX), accessibility, and web application security.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Computer Resources and Computer Lab<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p3">Computers are provided in the classroom for your use during class.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The ITEC department provides computers that have the required software installed. Please notify me or the college information technology helpdesk if any software is missing or not working on any college computer. You can only access the ITEC computers when the department is open.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">If you work on college computers, you should ensure that you are saving your work in another safe location. <b>Data stored locally on classroom computers or any other college computer, should be considered subject to access, deletion or modification at any time.</b></p>
<p class="p4"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>ALL students should back up their work regularly!! </b>Code storage and backup suggestions: store copies on at least two of the following: GitHub, flash drive, MCTC OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox….</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">You may find it helpful, although not required, that you have access to your own computer suitable for installing the class software; and that has internet access.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you use your own computer, you are responsible for determining whether software installed for this class is compatible with your computer and other software installed on your computer. You are solely responsible for the protection of your computer and backup of your data. The instructor (and college) are not liable for any damages you may suffer in connection with installing or using any software.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The instructor will not be able to provide any technical support for student computers. If you do not wish to install software on your own computer, you should use the ITEC department computers. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The college’s main computer lab is also available for your use but does not have the necessary software development tools installed on the computers.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Classroom Conduct</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p3">I endeavor to treat all students with integrity, fairness, honesty and respect.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Everyone in the classroom is responsible for creating a mutually respectful atmosphere, conducive to effective study, participation, and success of all students.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Behavior that negatively affects the ability of other students to participate in this class is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Behavior that negatively affects the freedom, rights, or safety of others will not be tolerated in this class.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Suggested Time Requirements</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p3">A six-credit class required 6 hours of classroom time. We’ve been assigned 4 hours per week, so you should prepare to spend an extra 2 hours working on classroom topics.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">In addition, a typical college class expects students to spend roughly 2 times the class hours per week on coding, assignments, projects, reading, and other class work. <b>So, you should expect to spend a minimum of an additional 12 hours per week working on this class.</b></p>
<p class="p4"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p3">This class might be harder than you expect. This class expects a lot of work! That's because learning to program is challenging, and takes time and practice. You will get out of this class what you put in. The more you practice, the more you will understand, and you will become a better programmer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The better programmer you are, the better the chance of finding employment in the field.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Every student is different and you may require more time, or less time, to be successful in this class.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b><i>Software development employers are not interested in software development students whose priority for their classes is simply the final grade.</i></b> Instead, make it a priority to <b>understand</b> the technologies used; so that you can apply them to projects beyond your assignments. Employers express a strong preference for students who spend the time to understand the technologies they are working with; for students who work on programs and projects beyond the required class work; for students who are resourceful and show initiative in solving problems, who ask questions; and demonstrate enthusiasm for software development. This approach builds your programming skills, understanding, and employability. And, this approach usually has a strong positive effect on your grades!</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Class Attendance and Participation</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b><i>You are expected to attend ALL scheduled on-campus classes for the full class session.</i></b></p>

<p class="p3">It is hoped that you will participate in discussions, ask questions, and answer questions during lectures.</p>
<p class="p3">You will need to take notes and save programs and solutions developed during the lecture time. You should keep copies of all code written during class time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">It is expected that you will work in pairs or groups during lab times, and will interact and participate in other classroom activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The class material is presented in a sequential fashion and each week builds upon skills learned in previous weeks. If you miss a class session, you will need to catch up as soon as possible. Check with another student to find out about material missed, or contact me.</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Class Structure and Communication</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p3">Most of the materials for this class are in D2L. Deadlines and due dates are in D2L.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Topics will be presented in 'active lecture' format during class. You will be introduced to topics and concepts, you will be asked questions; you will write code, and other activities. You should attend lectures, make notes, and work on the associated activities. Slides used during lectures are provided in D2L only as an outline of the topics covered, so attendance and participation in the class is essential.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">You will work on one lab assignment per week, writing code to solve programming problems.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">You will work on two projects during the class. One project will focus on front end (client side) technologies. Your final project will use all the skills developed in class.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Important news and announcements will be posted in the Announcements section of D2L, on the front page for this course. They may also be sent by email.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">You are expected to check your college email at least 3 times per week. Important class announcements will be sent by email. You can set up your college email to forward all emails to a personal email account if you prefer. Instructions for forwarding email to a personal account can be found at the student email website. Assistance with email is also available from the staff in the computer lab.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Classroom Labs</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p3">The class material is divided into topics. Each topic has an associated lab. Labs will include programming programs to analyze and solve, plus short-answer questions on concepts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">You will typically start the lab in class. You will finish any remaining work outside of class. You should submit the rest of your lab work to the correct dropbox by the deadline given – this typically is the day before the next class session.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Some labs ask you to build your own version of an application. The code for the finished app will be provided for you but you should NOT simply copy and paste the code. Even though the final code is available to you, it should be used as a reference only. <b>You need to build the applications yourself</b> so you can go through the process of configuring, creating, troubleshooting, and adding features to an application. <b>The code samples provided have hidden bytes which will be detected if you copy and paste the example code. Code that is copied from the sample code will be given a 0 grade.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p4"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Attendance Quizzes</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p3">Attendance is expected in every class session. You must take the weekly attendance quiz in class for credit for attendance. You may miss up to two class sessions without affecting your attendance grade.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Reading and Review Quizzes</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p3">You should prepare for each class by reviewing the materials in advance of that class. You will take a short quiz with a few multiple-choice questions. This quiz also asks what the most confusing part of last week’s class was; and what questions you have on the upcoming week’s materials.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Midterm Project</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p3">You will develop a client-side application, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p class="p3">Details for the project will be given in D2L.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Final Project</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p3">Your final project will ask you to build a larger, more complex application with both client and server side. This will be an individual project. You will need to use all the skills learned in class. As part of the project, you will participate in a code review, and present your final project to the class during the final week of the semester.</p>
<p class="p3">Full details for the final project will be given in D2L.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Extra Credit</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p3">Extra credit assignments may (or may not) be set. You can use these to develop more programming skills, or to make up missing assignments.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Extra credit questions may also be added to some labs and projects; in this case, you will find these in the lab worksheets/project instructions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b><i>Incomplete grades</i></b> will only be given in extreme circumstances; where a student faces severe difficulties in completing the class. Example: a student experiences a serious medical issue. Incomplete grades will be given at the instructor’s discretion, and with appropriate documentation. If you find yourself in these circumstances, please contact me. You must have completed a substantial amount of class work and also be passing the course at the time at which you request an incomplete grade.</p>

<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b><i>Projects and project deliverables </i></b>must be submitted by the given deadlines. These deadlines are final except in extenuating circumstances with supporting documentation. Late work/deliverables will receive a 0 grade.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Missing work will receive a 0 grade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remember that 0 grades significantly hurt your final grade - it is much better to submit partially-complete work for partial credit, than to not turn anything in.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Submitting Work</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p3">All work should be submitted by the given deadline. All deadlines are final except in extenuating circumstances with supporting documentation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">All work must be submitted by uploading it to the correct dropbox in D2L. For early labs, you will typically need to zip program code before uploading it to D2L.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or, you may upload work to GitHub and submit a link.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Projects and some labs will also require you to create an online repository for an application and submit the URL for this repository. You should upload the URL to the correct dropbox.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The format for uploads will be given in the lab or project description.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Anything uploaded to the wrong dropbox will not be graded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No labs or projects will be accepted by email.</p>
