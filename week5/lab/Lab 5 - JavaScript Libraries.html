  <p>Part 1:&nbsp;<strong>Drawing Program</strong>. (6 points) Start with the <a
      href="https://github.com/claraj/week5-examples/blob/master/canvas/mouse_drag.html" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">mouse drag program in the example repository</a>.&nbsp; Add the following features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Draw a small circles instead of a square.</li>
    <li>Add an input type="color" to select the drawing color</li>
    <li>Add an input type="range" to set the radius of the circles drawn, in effect setting the line width&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>(Optional: Extra credit available for best drawing drawn with your program)</p>
  <p>Part 2:&nbsp;<strong>Longest US Bridges Map</strong>. (7 points) Use the dataset below to draw
    a&nbsp;<strong>Leaflet</strong>&nbsp;map of all of the five bridges with the longest spans in the USA. Your map
    should have an appropriate center location and zoom level, to show all five bridges. Place a marker at each bridge
    location. Each marker should have a popup with the bridge's name and span length.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Put all of this data into an array of objects, and then loop over that array to create the markers and popups.
    Don't create separate markers in your code.</p>
  <p>Part 2a (Optional for extra credit +3 points) instead of the default marker, draw a bridge icon at the locations.
    You'll find a tutorial at Leaflet's website. Example icon:&nbsp;<a

  <p>Part 3:&nbsp;<strong>Longest US Bridges Chart.</strong>&nbsp;(5 points) Use the dataset below to draw a Chart.js
    <strong>bar chart</strong> of the bridge names and their span lengths.&nbsp; Can you use the array you created in
    part 2 to avoid typing the data into your program again?&nbsp;</p>
